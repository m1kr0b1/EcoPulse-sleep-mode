# EcoPulse-sleep-mode
This is a version of the EcoPulse software to use with a solar powered nodemcu.
The problem with the code provided by EcoPulse is that it relies your device to be connected to power non stop.
This way, you can plug it in to a solar charger and a battery, which allows you to place it on a more remote location.
This version uses WiFi, but you can adopt it to use LoRa as well.
